# Bonus Round Code

I prepared 3 code files specifically for the bonus round:  

- `bonus_model3mapd.py`: There are many training code files, but they are all different configurations of the same logic. This file is a tidy version of the training code, with more comments to explain how the model works.  
- `bonus_localization.py`: This file is a demonstration code of the localization ability. You can run it in the competition environment.  
- `check_cv_details.py`: This code can output the specific cv results of the model to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the model.
